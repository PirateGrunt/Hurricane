Will a hurricane ruin my vacation?
========================================================
On vacation with my family this week and that means I have a few minutes now and again to read. One of the books I brought along is Christopher Gandrud's excellent "Reproducible Research with R and RStudio".

Looking for some data as a test project, I latched onto Hurricane data. Folly Beach was hit pretty hard by hurricane Hugo in 1989. It's easy (though not terribly enjoyable) to imagine the damage such an event would do to a small coastal community like this. What's the likelihood that a hurricane will hit here again? What does it depend on? Obviously smarter minds than mine are hard at work on this. I can't hope to eclipse their knowledge, but this is a bit of fun to think about.

The project is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/PirateGrunt/Hurricane. If Gandrud has taught me anything, everything that I do will be easy to reproduce. As a first step, I show that (for this data) decade is a useful predictor for the number of hurricanes per year. I'm going to be a bit lazy and paste the HTML for the basic analysis file into this blog post. The raw code is available on GitHub.
