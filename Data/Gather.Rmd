Gather hurricane data
=====
Data on hurricanes has been taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, a branch of the US government.

This code chunk will fetch the data and write it to csv.
```{r}
library(RCurl)
URL = "ftp://eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/ibtracs/v03r04/wmo/csv/basin/Basin.NA.ibtracs_wmo.v03r04.csv"

df = getURL(URL)

filename = "Hurricanes.csv"

setwd("~/GitHub/Hurricane/Data/")

write.csv(df, filename)

rm(URL, filename, df)
